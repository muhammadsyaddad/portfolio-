# Immersive WebGL Landing Page

## The Vision

Creating an unforgettable first impression through a fully immersive 3D web experience. This landing page pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.

## Technical Implementation

### Three.js Scene Setup

The foundation of this project is a carefully optimized Three.js scene that runs smoothly across devices:

```javascript
// Scene initialization with performance optimizations
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
  antialias: true,
  powerPreference: 'high-performance'
});

// Adaptive quality based on device capabilities
const quality = detectDeviceCapabilities();
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, quality.maxPixelRatio));
```

### Shader Magic

Custom GLSL shaders bring the visuals to life:

```glsl
// Fragment shader for fluid effect
uniform float uTime;
uniform vec2 uMouse;
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
  vec2 uv = vUv;
  float distortion = sin(uv.x * 10.0 + uTime) * 0.1;
  vec3 color = vec3(uv.x + distortion, uv.y, 1.0 - uv.x);
  gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

## Performance Optimization

- **LOD System**: Dynamic level-of-detail based on camera distance
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render objects in view
- **Texture Compression**: KTX2 format for 70% smaller textures
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive asset loading with skeleton states

## User Interaction

The experience responds to user input in multiple ways:
- Mouse movement affects particle flow
- Scroll depth reveals new content layers
- Click interactions trigger micro-animations

## Results

- Average session duration: 4.2 minutes
- Bounce rate: 15% (industry average: 45%)
- Performance score: 92/100 on Lighthouse
