# Building with AI: Lessons Learned

After spending the past year integrating various AI services into production applications, I've collected some valuable lessons that I wish I knew from the start.

## Lesson 1: Prompts Are Code

Treat your prompts like code. Version control them, test them, and review them.

```typescript
// Bad: Inline prompts scattered everywhere
const response = await ai.complete("Summarize this: " + text);

// Good: Centralized, versioned prompts
import { SUMMARIZE_PROMPT_V2 } from '@/prompts/summarization';

const response = await ai.complete(
  SUMMARIZE_PROMPT_V2.format({ content: text, maxLength: 100 })
);
```

## Lesson 2: Plan for Latency

AI responses are inherently slower than traditional API calls. Design your UX around this:

- Use streaming responses when possible
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Show meaningful loading states
- Cache aggressively

## Lesson 3: Handle Failures Gracefully

AI services can fail, hallucinate, or return unexpected results. Always have fallbacks:

```typescript
const getAIResponse = async (prompt: string): Promise<string> => {
  try {
    const response = await aiService.complete(prompt);
    if (!validateResponse(response)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid response');
    }
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.warn('AI fallback triggered', { error, prompt });
    return getFallbackResponse(prompt);
  }
};
```

## Lesson 4: Cost Management

AI API calls add up quickly. Implement:

- Rate limiting per user
- Token usage tracking
- Caching layers
- Budget alerts

## Lesson 5: User Education

Users need to understand:
- AI can make mistakes
- Results may vary
- Human review is still valuable

## Conclusion

AI is a powerful tool, but it requires thoughtful integration. The best AI features feel like magic to users while being rock-solid behind the scenes.
